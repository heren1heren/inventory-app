# Games inventory-app

<<<<<<< HEAD
1 Set up an Express project and a new PostgreSQL database.

1 Before you begin, take a moment to write down all of the database tables and its fields you’ll need, as well as the relations between them For example:

    In a game management app, there can be a game, genre, and developer entity. A game can have one or multiple developers and genres. Similarly a developer can develop multiple games.
    In a pokemon management app, there can be a pokemon, trainer and a type entity. Each pokemon must be contained in a type. While a trainer can have multiple pokemons.

Any sufficient inventory app will have relations and constraints against its entities. Figure out these database particulars for your inventory app.
Set up the routes and controllers you’re going to need.
Create all of the ‘READ’ views (i.e. view category, and view item).
